# Lessons Learned and Challenges Overcome

## Introduction

In this blog post, I'll share my journey through Java Backend Development, focusing on the key lessons I learned and the challenges I overcame.

## Starting with the Basics of Web

My journey began with the basics: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Understanding HTTP requests and responses was initially challenging, but practice with tools like curl and Postman, especially with the GitHub API, helped me grasp these concepts.

## Demystifying CORS

Understanding Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) was tricky at first. I wondered why there were limitations on resource sharing between websites. Researching into web security concepts helped me appreciate the importance of CORS for protecting web applications.

## Diving into Spring Boot

Entering the world of Spring Boot was a significant step up. Integrating Thymeleaf for dynamic HTML pages required persistence and a lot of learning. The experience enriched my understanding of server-side functionalities.

## Exploring Databases and SQL

Learning about databases and SQL was crucial. Designing a database schema for a blog system pushed me to think critically about data relationships and efficiency. It was challenging, but it significantly improved my understanding of database management.

## Embracing JPA in Spring Boot

Incorporating JPA into my Spring Boot project was a game-changer. Despite the initial complexity, it simplified my interactions with databases and made my code more efficient, offering a practical glimpse into the power of ORM.

## Tackling Debugging Challenges

One of my biggest learning moments came from resolving a bug caused by a small typo in a query method name. It was a painstaking process, but it highlighted the importance of detail and precision in programming.

## Conclusion: A Journey of Growth

This journey in Java backend development was about more than just coding; it was a pathway to understanding the deeper aspects of technology. I hope my experiences can encourage others who are navigating similar paths.
